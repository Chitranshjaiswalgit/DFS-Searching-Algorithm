# DFS-Searching-Algorithm
This Python code implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse a graph representing the map of Romania. It begins at the initial state "Arad" and explores paths until it reaches the goal state "Bucharest". The algorithm uses a priority queue to manage node exploration based on a priority function, backtracking when necessary. The graph is defined with cities as nodes and connections as edges. The code also prints the path found by the DFS algorithm. This demonstrates skills in graph traversal, priority queue handling, and the implementation of the DFS algorithm for problem-solving.
