# DFS-Searching-Algorithm

The Python code implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the city of Arad to Bucharest in Romania. The DFS algorithm is implemented using a priority queue and a dictionary to keep track of nodes and their respective costs. The code begins by initializing a global variable global_node_id to keep track of node IDs. The function get_next_node_id() increments this global variable whenever a new node is encountered.

The DFS algorithm itself is implemented in the DepthFirstSearch() function. It takes a problem object as input, which defines the initial state, goal state, possible actions, and their associated costs. Inside the function, a dictionary D is used to store the parent node and the cost associated with reaching each state, while a priority queue Q is used to store nodes prioritized based on their costs. The algorithm iteratively explores nodes in the priority queue until the goal state is reached. At each iteration, it pops the node with the lowest cost from the priority queue, checks if it is the goal state, and if not, expands it by considering its child states and their associated costs. The algorithm then updates the dictionary D with the new cost for each child state and adds them to the priority queue. This process continues until the goal state is reached or all possible paths have been explored.

The priority_function() determines the priority of a state based on its distance from the initial state. The RomaniaProblem class defines the problem specific to the map of Romania, including the initial state, goal state, possible actions, and their associated costs.

In the main block, a sample graph representing the map of Romania is defined, and an instance of the RomaniaProblem class is created. The DFS algorithm is then applied to this problem instance, and the resulting path from Arad to Bucharest is printed. Overall, this code demonstrates how DFS can be used to efficiently find a path from one city to another in a graph-based problem such as the map of Romania.
