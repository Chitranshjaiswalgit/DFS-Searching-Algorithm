## Project Overview
The Python code implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the city of Arad to Bucharest in Romania. The DFS algorithm is implemented using a priority queue and a dictionary to keep track of nodes and their respective costs. The code begins by initializing a global variable `global_node_id` to keep track of node IDs. The function `get_next_node_id()` increments this global variable whenever a new node is encountered.


## Installation
This project requires Python 3.12.1 or later.
To set up the project:
1. Ensure Python 3.12.1 or a later version is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   
            git clone https://github.com/jaiswalchitransh/DFS-Searching-Algorithm
        
3. Open the project in your preferred Python environment (e.g., IDE or terminal).
4. Run the script (`dfs_searching_algo.py`) and observe the output.


## Usage
Run the script:

            python dfs_searching_algo.py
  
This executes the DFS algorithm to find a path from Arad to Bucharest in the Romania map graph.


## Features
- **Implementation**: Implements DFS using a priority queue for efficient pathfinding.
- **Output**: Outputs the path from Arad to Bucharest.
- **Demonstration**: Demonstrates dictionary usage for node management and cost calculation.
