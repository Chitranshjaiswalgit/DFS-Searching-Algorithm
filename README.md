# DFS-Searching-Algorithm
This Python code employs the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from "Arad" to "Bucharest" in the Romania map. It uses a priority queue, backtracking, and a graph representation. The DFS path is printed at the end. Skills demonstrated include graph traversal, priority queue usage, and DFS algorithm implementation.
